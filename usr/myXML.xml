  //TODO write this up!!!

  This XML config has to conform some very strict structure due to the fact
  that it is expected to be read by some very primitive software, possibly
  running on a very limited hardware.

  NO SPACES ARE ALLOWED INSIDE ATTRIBUTE VALUES !!!
  sorry for that

  NO SPACES ARE ALLOWED BETWEEN THE ATTRIBUTE NAME, '=' SIGN AND THE ATTRIBUTE VALUE !!!
  sorry for that

  Thus it has to be strictly: name="value"


  Raw message received from the electronics block CAEN V775 (elblock="V775")
  is parsed: electronics channel 'ch' and TDC value are extracted.
  Output ??? (how do we call this entity) is formed as if this message comes
  from the left square telescope and contains time information.
  This ??? is pushed into the "tSQX_L" branch of the output tree(station="tSQX_L")
  which will be located in the detector "Left_telescope" (detector="Left_telescope").

  ????????

  Additional check can be implemented with the aid of a FIXED electronics description file
  electronics.xml

  module=geo
  Module term is used by MESYTEC and geo is used by CAEN.

  If there is data coming from some channel which you want to ignore, use "Ignore" station name.
  If you don't - the 'Learn' step of the analysis will warn you that there is data from unmapped channels.

  XML reminder
  ============

  'Standard' combination consists of an opening tag which starts with the '<' sign
  and the closing tag which starts with the '</' sign. Both end with the '>' sign.
  A closing tag should have no attributes.

  <tag attribute1="value">
  </tag>

  Self-closing tag starts with the '<' sign and ends with the '/>' sign.
  Obviously, it needs no closing tag.

  <tag attribute1="value" attribute2="value"/>

  Attributes are separated by spaces or tabs (no commas!)

  Double-quotes around the attribute value are necessary.

  Order or attributes does not matter - it is ignored by any clever (=correctly) developed software.

  There can be missing attributes if the reading software covers such situations.
  In our particular case 'stepelectrch' attribute can be omitted while all the other are necessary.
  If omitted, stepelectrch=1
